# Relocation Welcome Package

Produces a personalized, locally-specific welcome package for relocating clients. This is Claire's work: specificity is the service. "Great restaurants nearby" is not a deliverable — naming the chef and what to order is.

## What You Need From the User

- **Client profile:** name(s), family composition (kids' ages, pets), lifestyle interests, where they're coming from
- **Destination:** city, neighborhood, specific address if known
- **Motivation:** job transfer / lifestyle / family / retirement / investment
- **Timeline:** move-in date or target range
- **Priorities:** schools / commute / walkability / social scene / specific needs

The more detail provided, the more personalized the package. If details are sparse, generate a strong template with `[PERSONALIZE: ...]` callouts.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Welcome to [Neighborhood], [City] 🏡
*A personal guide prepared for [Client Name(s)] by Claire, Concierge & Relocation Specialist*
*Prepared: [Date] | Move-in target: [Date]*

## Your Concierge Contact

**Claire** — Concierge & Relocation Specialist
[Phone] | [Email]

*I'll check in with you one week after move-in. Text me anytime before then — no question is too small. If something on this list is wrong or outdated, I want to know.*

*And if you know anyone else who might be making a move — to or from this area — I'd be honored to help them too.*
```

## Behavior Notes

- **Specificity over completeness.** A package with 5 specific, accurate, locally-grounded recommendations is worth more than 20 generic ones.
- **Always personalize to the client's stated interests.** A couple with a toddler gets a different package than a retiring couple. A remote worker cares about the coffee shop wifi. A runner wants the trail.
- **Mark anything unverifiable.** Use `⚠️ [Verify before sending]` for anything like "accepting new patients" or hours that may have changed.
- **The "insider thing" is the most valuable line in the package.** Push yourself to find it — or if you can't, use `[PERSONALIZE: Ask the listing agent or a local — this is the line that makes the package feel real]`.
- If user says "make it shorter": cut the dining section in half and collapse logistics into a bulleted checklist. Keep the neighborhood character paragraph and the first-week checklist.
- Always close with Claire's contact note — the package is a relationship tool, not just an information dump.
