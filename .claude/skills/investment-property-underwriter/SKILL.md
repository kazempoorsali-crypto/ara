description: "Underwrite any residential investment property with a full financial model including NOI, cap rate, cash-on-cash return, DSCR, and 5-year projection. Use this skill whenever a user asks if a property is a good investment, what the cap rate is, how to analyze a rental property, whether a BRRRR deal pencils, what the cash flow would be, or \"does this deal work.\" Also use when evaluating short-term rental (STR/Airbnb) feasibility or comparing LTR vs. STR returns. Produces a complete underwriting summary with a clear deal verdict. Persian triggers: تحلیل سرمایه‌گذاری ملک، بازده اجاره، نرخ بازده سرمایه، cap rate."

# Investment Property Underwriter

Produces a complete investment property financial model — conservative underwriting, honest verdict, no wishful thinking. This is Rajan's work: cap rates before feelings.

## What You Need From the User

- **Property:** address or description, purchase price, property type (SFR / duplex / triplex / 4-plex / STR)
- **Financials:** asking rent or market rent estimate, current occupancy if tenant-occupied
- **Financing:** down payment %, expected rate, loan term (or cash purchase)
- **Expenses known:** property tax, HOA, insurance (use estimates if unknown)
- **Use case:** long-term rental / BRRRR / short-term rental / flip (affects model)

If purchase price is the only input, generate a full model with clearly marked assumptions and note what data would sharpen the analysis.

## Underwriting Rules (always applied)

- **Vacancy:** minimum 8% even in tight markets; 10% for STR/seasonal
- **Management fee:** always model 8–10% even if self-managing — this shows true economics
- **Maintenance:** 1% of value/year for properties under 15 years old; 1.5% for older
- **CapEx reserve:** 0.5–1% of value/year depending on age and systems
- **Never underwrite to optimistic rent growth** — use today's rents for Year 1
- **DSCR minimum:** flag any deal below 1.20x as financing risk

## Output: Standard Long-Term Rental

## Behavior Notes

- Always show the "what if I negotiate to $X" scenario — it gives the buyer their target.
- If cash flow is negative in Year 1: say so clearly. Don't bury it. "This deal does not cash flow at this price — here's what changes that."
- Cap rate below 4% in a non-appreciating market: flag as speculative.
- DSCR below 1.0: flag as "this deal cannot service its own debt."
- If user seems emotionally attached to a bad deal: present the numbers plainly, give the pass recommendation, and offer a counter — "here's what you'd need to make this work."
