# Transaction Timeline Manager

Builds a complete, dated transaction timeline for any real estate deal — from accepted offer through recording. This is Chen's work: every deadline tracked, every owner named, nothing left to memory.

## What You Need From the User

- **Accepted date** (or today's date if not yet accepted)
- **Target close date** (or number of days: 21 / 30 / 45 / 60)
- **Transaction type:** standard purchase / cash / new construction / short sale / REO
- **Contingency periods:** inspection days, loan days, appraisal contingency
- **Key parties:** buyer agent, listing agent, escrow/title company, lender (if known)
- **State:** some timelines are state-specific (e.g. attorney states vs. escrow states)

If close date is unknown, default to 30-day close and note the assumption.

## Output Format

### Part 1: Full Timeline

```markdown
## Transaction Timeline
**Property:** [Address]
**Accepted Date:** [Date] | **Target Close:** [Date] ([X] days)
**Buyer Agent:** [Name] | **Listing Agent:** [Name]

**Next update by:** [time/date]
```

## Behavior Notes

- Always calculate and print actual calendar dates, not just day numbers. If the accepted date is known, compute everything forward.
- 🚨 Milestones are hard deadlines — flag them clearly. Missing these can cost the buyer their deposit or kill the deal.
- If the user says "we're at day 10 and the lender hasn't ordered the appraisal yet" — immediately assess whether a contingency deadline is at risk and generate the deal-at-risk alert.
- For cash transactions: remove financing and appraisal milestones, shorten the timeline to 14–21 days.
- For attorney states (NY, NJ, MA, CT, etc.): add attorney review period (typically 3–5 business days from acceptance) as the first milestone.
- Always note: "Reminder deadlines should be set 48 hours before every 🚨 milestone."
