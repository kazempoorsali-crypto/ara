# Connect Your MLS to Claude

This skill helps a real estate agent bring their own local MLS data into Claude and analyze it: market reports, comparable sales, days on market, price per square foot, and listing analysis. It works for any agent in the United States.

## The reality of MLS data (set expectations first)

There is no single national MLS. There are hundreds of local MLS systems, and each one is different. Some offer an API or an IDX data feed; many do not. So there are two ways an agent gets their data into Claude:

1. **Export (works for everyone).** In your MLS, run the search you want, active, pending, or sold, for your area and timeframe, then export the results to a CSV or spreadsheet. Bring that file into Claude and ask it to analyze it. This is the universal path, and this skill assumes it.
2. **API or IDX feed (only if your MLS offers one).** Some MLS systems provide a feed that an integration can pull from. Check what your specific MLS actually provides before you plan around it, because plenty of MLS systems offer no feed at all.

## How to use it

Ask the agent for two things:
- What they want: a market report for clients, a comps analysis for pricing, a listing's competitive position, or days-on-market trends.
- Their exported MLS data (CSV or spreadsheet) for the area and timeframe.

Then help them:
- Summarize the market honestly, using only the numbers in the file: median and average price, days on market, price per square foot, and active versus sold counts.
- Build a client-ready market report or a comps narrative.
- Compare a subject listing to the comps that are actually in the data.

## Rules (non-negotiable)

- Use only the numbers in the agent's file. Do not invent a price, a comp, a school rating, or a trend. If the data is not there, say so plainly.
- Fair Housing compliant: describe the market and the homes, not the buyers or who "should" live somewhere. No school-as-a-selling-point, no demographic steering, no coded community rankings.
- Plain, honest analysis. No hype, no scarcity language. No em dashes.
- Every MLS has its own rules about how its data may be used and displayed. Respect your MLS's rules; this skill helps you analyze data you are entitled to use.
